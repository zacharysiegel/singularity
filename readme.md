# Singularity

_A game of production and diplomacy_

This game is designed to facilitate organic, complex social interactions between players as each vies for supremacy over the others. Taking inspiration from [Subterfuge](http://subterfuge-game.com/), though the game occurs in "real time", the rate of time progression is slow enough to allow strategies and alliances to develop over the course of days or weeks. Players may tactically engage opponents in violent conflict, but they must also carefully develop resouces and chains. This element of the game utilizes factory-building mechanics to allow players to specialize production to suit their specific geographic, social, or military needs. Thus, the realms of military and economy are blurred, fortifying bonds between players and intensifying every decision.
